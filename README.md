# Homelab

The documentation and configuration files for the homelab that I am building.

The goal for this homelab is to not only teach myself Kubernetes but to also self host various services that I find useful for myself.

## Hardware

For hardware, I am using my old MSI GS63VR gaming laptop with the following specs:

- Intel i7-7700HQ
- 16 GB DDR4-2400MHz
- 256 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD
- NVIDIA GTX 1060 6GB GDDR5

The laptop itself is running Ubuntu Server 24.04 along with K3S for my Kubernetes distribution.

## Apps

List of apps that I am either working on or planning to add to my homelab:

- [linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) (In Progress)
